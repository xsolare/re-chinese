    "description": " <p>        Each Chinese character is a separate syllable that can be pronounced in one of five keys. Precisely the tones        Chinese represent the greatest difficulty for studying, because analogues in mother tongue usually not.        Nevertheless, after a certain, sometimes short, practice, depending on the hearing of the student, there comes a        moment when the tones begin to differ by ear. To write Chinese syllables taking into account tones, there is a        Pinyin system based on the Latin alphabet.      </p>      \n      <ul>        <li>          <p>            <b>First tone</b>- pronounced high and even, like the squeak of a Morse code. Denoted by a straight line            above the letter mā or simply ma1.          </p>        </li>        \n        <li>          <p>            <b>Second tone</b>- ascending from medium to high, sounds like a peculiar question. Denoted má or ma2.          </p>        </li>        \n        <li>          <p>            <b>Third tone</b>- low falling, and then rising to the average level. The tone is more like the Russian            interjection 'Well!?'. Denoted mă or ma3.          </p>        </li>        \n        <li>          <p>            <b>fourth tone</b>- falling from high to low, sounds like a kind of statement. Denoted by mà or ma4.          </p>        </li>        \n        <li>          <p>            <b>A syllable without a tone</b>- is not indicated in any way and is pronounced without tonality.          </p>        </li>        \n      </ul>"
